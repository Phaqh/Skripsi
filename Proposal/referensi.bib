	abstract = {Cooperation in organisms, whether bacteria or primates, has been a difficulty for evolutionary theory since Darwin. On the assumption that interactions between pairs of individuals occur on a probabilistic basis, a model is developed based on the concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy in the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Deductions from the model, and the results of a computer tournament show how cooperation based on reciprocity can get started in an asocial world, can thrive while interacting with a wide range of other strategies, and can resist invasion once fully established. Potential applications include specific aspects of territoriality, mating, and disease.},

(iii) We take a more critical tone raising practical challenges of MDRL (e.g., implementation and computational demands).

By formulating fitness-driven dynamical equations, theoretical and numerical results reveal that cooperators exhibit dominance in steady-state under pairwise comparison rules, whereas extortion strategies demonstrate significant invasion characteristics in scale-free networks under death-birth update rule. Notably, the influence of both temptation and extortion factors on cooperation evolution exhibits a pronounced rule-dependent phenomenon. By decoupling the multidimensional coupling effects of network topology, strategy update rule and payoff parameters, we establish critical criteria for cooperation evolution. These findings provide a dynamical theoretical basis for illustrating cooperation emergence mechanisms in complex social networks and designing intervention strategies to enhance collective cooperation.},

	abstract = {Coordination, i.e., multiple autonomous agents in a system to achieve a common goal, is critical for distributed systems since it can increase the overall reward among all agents. However, The dynamic environment and selfish agents pose challenges to learning coordination behavior from historical interaction data in a long-term interaction environment. Previous works mostly focus on one-shot or short-term distributed agent interaction environments, which often leads to selfish or lazy behavior in long-term interaction environments, i.e., prioritizing individual optimal strategies over cooperative strategies. This behavior is mainly due to the lack of historical memory or incomplete use of historical interaction data to guide the current interaction strategy. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical peer-rewarding mechanism, hierarchical gifting, that allows each agent to dynamically assign some of their rewards to other agents based on historical interaction data and guide the agents towards more coordinated behavior while ensuring that agents remain selfish and decentralized. Specifically, we first propose an auxiliary opponent modeling task so that agents can infer opponents’ types through historical interaction trajectories. In addition, we design a hierarchical gifting strategy that dynamically changes during execution based on known opponents’ types. We employ a theoretical framework that captures the benefit of hierarchical gifting in converging to the coordinated behavior by characterizing the equilibria’s basins of attraction in a dynamical system. With hierarchical gifting, we demonstrate increased coordinated behavior of different risk, general-sum coordination games to the prosocial equilibrium both via numerical analysis and experiments.},

We review and situate various frameworks for recursive modeling that have been studied in game- and decision- theories, and have yielded methods useful to AI researchers. Sustained attention given to these frameworks has produced new analyses and methods with an aim toward making recursive modeling practicable. Indeed, we also review some emerging uses and the insights these yielded, which are indicative of pragmatic progress in this area. The significance of these frameworks is that higher-order reasoning is critical to correctly recognizing others' intent or outthinking opponents. Such reasoning has been utilized in academic, business, military, security, and other contexts both to train and inform decision-making agents in organizational and strategic contexts, and also to more realistically predict and best respond to other agents' intent.},

We characterise this novel game's Nash equilibria and propose a multiagent multi-armed bandit system that learns to converge to approximations of such equilibria. Our research contributes value to the areas of game theory and multiagent systems, paving the way for a better understanding of voluntary collaborative dynamics. We examine how team heterogeneity, task typology, and assessment difficulty influence agents' strategies and resulting teamwork outcomes. Finally, we empirically study the behaviour of work teams under incentive systems that defy analytical treatment. Our agents demonstrate human-like behaviour patterns, corroborating findings from social psychology research.},

	abstract = {The emergence of cooperation is a central issue in understanding collective behavior and evolution. The eco-evolutionary game model introduces a human–environment coupling mechanism, revealing that the feedback between strategies and the relevant environment is a key element in sustaining long-term cooperation. Previous theoretical studies have observed periodic oscillations between cooperative and defective actions under certain conditions. However, such investigations assume cooperators hold a benefit advantage over defectors, which does not fundamentally illuminate how cooperation emerges. Our paper emphasizes that understanding this issue requires considering inherent human memory characteristics. We refine the eco-evolutionary game model using reinforcement learning, constructing a multi-agent system that couples environment and memory-based decision-making. Comprehensive analyses encompass collective and individual perspectives. Our findings show that with the memory mechanism, oscillations between collective cooperation and defection can still occur, even if defection remains a strict Nash equilibrium. Cooperation emerges from the group’s random exploratory actions in depleted environments, altering the environment’s trends. A positive feedback loop forms among the environment, individual rewards, and actions, stabilizing cooperation as a favorable individual strategy at that point. However, established group cooperation leads individuals seeking optimal behavior to transition from cooperators to defectors through exploration, resulting in cooperation collapse. Subsequently, the memory mechanism reengages, diluting defectors’ expected payoffs and initiating a new round of exploratory behavior within the group. Our results unveil the micro-level mechanisms driving cyclic oscillations, enhancing our understanding of the environment-strategy interplay.},

	abstract = {The emergence of cooperation in decentralized multi-agent systems is challenging; naive implementations of learning algorithms typically fail to converge or converge to equilibria without cooperation. Opponent modeling techniques, combined with reinforcement learning, have been successful in promoting cooperation, but face challenges when other agents are plentiful or anonymous. We envision environments in which agents face a sequence of interactions with different and heterogeneous agents. Inspired by models of evolutionary game theory, we introduce RL agents that forgo explicit modeling of others. Instead, they augment their reward signal by considering how to best respond to others assumed to be rational against their own strategy. This technique not only scales well in environments with many agents, but can also outperform opponent modeling techniques across a range of cooperation games. Agents that use the algorithm we propose can successfully maintain and establish cooperation when playing against an ensemble of diverse agents. This finding is robust across different kinds of games and can also be shown not to disadvantage agents in purely competitive interactions. While cooperation in pairwise settings is foundational, interactions across large groups of diverse agents are likely to be the norm in future applications where cooperation is an emergent property of agent design, rather than a design goal at the system level. The algorithm we propose here is a simple and scalable step in this direction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In repeated zero-sum games, instead of constantly playing an equilibrium strategy of the stage game, learning to exploit the opponent given historical interactions could typically obtain a higher utility. However, when playing against a fully adaptive opponent, one would have difficulty identifying the opponent’s adaptive dynamics and further exploiting its potential weakness. In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing against the adaptive opponent who uses no-regret learning. No-regret learning is a classic and widely-used branch of adaptive learning algorithms. We propose a general framework for online modeling no-regret opponents and exploiting their weakness. With this framework, one could approximate the opponent’s no-regret learning dynamics and then develop a response plan to obtain a significant profit based on the inferences of the opponent’s strategies. We employ two system identification architectures, including the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model, and adopt an efficient greedy response plan within the framework. Theoretically, we prove the approximation capability of our RNN architecture at approximating specific no-regret dynamics. Empirically, we demonstrate that during interactions at a low level of non-stationarity, our architectures could approximate the dynamics with a low error, and the derived policies could exploit the no-regret opponent to obtain a decent utility. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A major challenge in cognitive science and AI has been to understand how intelligent autonomous agents might acquire and predict the behavioral and mental states of other agents in the course of complex social interactions. How does such an agent model the goals, beliefs, and actions of other agents it interacts with? What are the computational principles to model a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Deep learning approaches to address these questions fall short of a better understanding of the problem. In part, this is due to the black-box nature of deep networks, wherein computational mechanisms of ToM are not readily revealed. Here, we consider alternative hypotheses seeking to model how the brain might realize a ToM. In particular, we propose embodied and situated agent models based on distributed adaptive control theory to predict the actions of other agents in five different game-theoretic tasks (Harmony Game, Hawk-Dove, Stag Hunt, Prisoner’s Dilemma, and Battle of the Exes). Our multi-layer control models implement top-down predictions from adaptive to reactive layers of control and bottom-up error feedback from reactive to adaptive layers. We test cooperative and competitive strategies among seven different agent models (cooperative, greedy, tit-for-tat, reinforcement-based, rational, predictive, and internal agents). We show that, compared to pure reinforcement-based strategies, probabilistic learning agents modeled on rational, predictive, and internal phenotypes perform better in game-theoretic metrics across tasks. The outlined autonomous multi-agent models might capture systems-level processes underlying a ToM and suggest architectural principles of ToM from a control-theoretic perspective. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been used extensively in the game environment. One of the main challenges in MARL is that the environment of the agent system is dynamic, and the other agents are also updating their strategies. Therefore, modeling the opponents’ learning process and adopting specific strategies to shape learning is an effective way to obtain better training results. Previous studies such as DRON, LOLA and SOS approximated the opponent’s learning process and gave effective applications. However, these studies modeled only transient changes in opponent strategies and lacked stability in the improvement of equilibrium efficiency. In this article, we design the MOL (modeling opponent learning) method based on the Stackelberg game. We use best response theory to approximate the opponents’ preferences for different actions and explore stable equilibrium with higher rewards. We find that MOL achieves better results in several games with classical structures (the Prisoner’s Dilemma, Stackelberg Leader game and Stag Hunt with 3 players), and in randomly generated bimatrix games. MOL performs well in competitive games played against different opponents and converges to stable points that score above the Nash equilibrium in repeated game environments. The results may provide a reference for the definition of equilibrium in multiagent reinforcement learning systems, and contribute to the design of learning objectives in MARL to avoid local disadvantageous equilibrium and improve general efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We focus on the speed of information update about social environments and study the relationships between the resulting patterns of cooperation in different information update rates.

	abstract = {The Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma has guided research on social dilemmas for decades. However, it distinguishes between only two atomic actions: cooperate and defect. In real-world prisoner’s dilemmas, these choices are temporally extended and different strategies may correspond to sequences of actions, reflecting grades of cooperation. We introduce a Sequential Prisoner’s Dilemma (SPD) game to better capture the aforementioned characteristics. In this work, we propose a deep multiagent reinforcement-learning approach that investigates the evolution of mutual cooperation in SPD games. Our approach consists of two phases. The first phase is offline: it synthesizes policies with different cooperation degrees and then trains a cooperation degree detection network. The second phase is online: an agent adaptively selects its policy based on the detected degree of opponent cooperation. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in two representative SPD 2D games: the Apple-Pear game and the Fruit Gathering game. Experimental results show that our strategy can avoid being exploited by exploitative opponents and achieve cooperation with cooperative opponents. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

            In human society, the conflict between self-interest and collective well-being often obstructs efforts to achieve shared welfare. Related concepts like the Tragedy of the Commons and Social Dilemmas frequently manifest in our daily lives. As artificial agents increasingly serve as autonomous proxies for humans, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method to address this issue - learning policies to maximise collective returns even when individual agents’ interests conflict with the collective one. Unlike traditional cooperative MARL solutions that involve sharing rewards, values, and policies or designing intrinsic rewards to encourage agents to learn collectively optimal policies, we propose a novel MARL approach where agents exchange action suggestions. Our method reveals less private information compared to sharing rewards, values, or policies, while enabling effective cooperation without the need to design intrinsic rewards. Our algorithm is supported by our theoretical analysis that establishes a bound on the discrepancy between collective and individual objectives, demonstrating how sharing suggestions can align agents’ behaviours with the collective objective. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs competitively with baselines that rely on value or policy sharing or intrinsic rewards.},

              In social interactions, people often reason about the beliefs, goals and intentions of others. This
              theory of mind
              allows them to interpret the behavior of others, and predict how they will behave in the future. People can also use this ability recursively: they use
              higher-order theory of mind
              to reason about the theory of mind abilities of others, as in “he thinks that I don’t know that he sent me an anonymous letter”. Previous agent-based modeling research has shown that the usefulness of higher-order theory of mind reasoning can be useful across competitive, cooperative, and mixed-motive settings. In this paper, we cast a new light on these results by investigating how the predictability of the environment influences the effectiveness of higher-order theory of mind. Our results show that the benefit of (higher-order) theory of mind reasoning is strongly dependent on the predictability of the environment. We consider agent-based simulations in repeated one-shot negotiations in a particular negotiation setting known as Colored Trails. When this environment is highly predictable, agents obtain little benefit from theory of mind reasoning. However, if the environment has more observable features that change over time, agents without the ability to use theory of mind experience more difficulties predicting the behavior of others accurately. This in turn allows theory of mind agents to obtain higher scores in these more dynamic environments. These results suggest that the human-specific ability for higher-order theory of mind reasoning may have evolved to allow us to survive in more complex and unpredictable environments.},
